## ✍️ **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Creative Design:**
The design was inspired by the game Motherload. A 2D mining game. The style was inspired by Muten Roshi and Terminator. The sprites were fun to design and a lot of creativity went into designing them

- **Core Mechanics:** The gravity and movement mechanic were challenging to make. In the end it worked out, but there are still some minor bugs or lets say features 😉

### Challenges:
- **Time Constraints:** Implementing all the features we envisioned wasn’t possible due to the limited timeframe.
- **Bug Fixes:** Handling collisions and edge cases for gravity mechanics was tricky. Also the jetpack movement where challenging to make, because you I also needed to consider how the gravity is applied when using the jetpack.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Prototyping Matters:** Testing early prototypes helped refine the core mechanics quickly.
- **Keep it Simple:** Focusing on one unique mechanic instead of multiple features made the game more polished.

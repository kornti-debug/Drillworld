## ‚úçÔ∏è **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Creative Design:**
The design was inspired by the game Motherload. A 2D mining game. The character style was inspired by Muten Roshi and Terminator. The sprites were fun to design and a lot of creativity went into designing them.

- **Core Mechanics:** The gravity and movement mechanic were challenging to make. In the end it worked out, but there are still some minor bugs or lets say features üòâ

- **Shop Mechanic:** The shop mechanic was fun to make, because it added more depth and strategy to the game. This mechanic can be expanded a lot more and add more depth to the game.

### Challenges:
- **Time Constraints:** I couldn't implement all features i wanted to have in this game, because I run out of time. However I could implement the core mechanics which was very important.
- **Movement:** The movement of the character was tricky, because i needed to have a working gravity function and also jetpack function so the character was able to fly. 
- **Bug Fixes:** Handling collisions and edge cases for gravity mechanics was tricky. Also the jetpack movement where challenging to make, because you I also needed to consider how the gravity is applied when using the jetpack.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Prototyping Matters:** Testing early prototypes helped me to fix bugs quickly and gave me an overview which mechanics and game design decisions i could focus on.
- **Keep it Simple:** I had many more features in my mind, but i am glad that i focused on the important core of the game, so the game can still be extended over time.
